What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

In the directory where I have initialized a repository appears new hidden directory .git,
which contains all necessary files for git. I need to do it, because I would like to follow,
control my code, all versions of the code.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

To be honest I still don't get the notion or the idead of staging area. The staging area is a file, generally contained in your Git directory, that stores information about what will go into your next commit. It’s sometimes referred to as the “index”, but it’s also common to refer to it as the staging area. It offers an important value - we store into the St.Area the files which we'd like to commit. So it's important for the whole idea of version control of our code.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
