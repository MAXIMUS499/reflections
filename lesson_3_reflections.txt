When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Well, in case I need to show my code for other people as well as I would like that they contribute in my code

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Idk. Time will show me and one day I'll fill the answer =)

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

   fork - it is when you make a copy of somebody's repository on your GitHub account.
   clone - it is when you make a copy of somebody's repository on your local machine.
   branches - it is a Git's feature which allows you to create other versions of your main code in your project.
   I would use fork when I'd like to have someone's interesting repository on my GitHub page.
   I would use clone when I'd like to have someone's interesting repository on local machine.
   I would use branches when I'd like to create some experimental feature of my code(project).

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
